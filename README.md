# Random Gen 
This is an app I made for random generation. Nothing superfancy, but it does have a navigation bar that directs users to a page where you can get a random number between 2 numbers, a random English character between 2 characters, and a random item from a list users can create.

The idea behind this was to create a simple and easy solution for myself to use while making other projects where placement of items or things needed to be more randomized, but not done dynamically.

This was made using Kotlin in Android Studio, and while it is completed, I will be revisiting and updating it after my schooling is finished.
